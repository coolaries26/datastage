restart datastage
check if anyone is connected
ps -ef | grep -i phantom
ps -ef | grep dsapi
ps -ef | grep dscs
These commands should not return any results. If they return results, it means that there are still some processes running. You can wait for the users to stop their processes or kill the processes (using kill -9 PID).

Check if dsrpc is running
	netstat -a | grep dsrpc
If dsrpc is running, then you should get a line with the status LISTEN. If you get more lines it means that there are still some connections and you need to wait. If you see that dsrpc or other connections are in status WAIT then you also need to wait until this it disappears (you can also reboot the machine).


Stop
	cd /opt/IBM/InformationServer/Server/DSEngine
	bin/uv -admin -stop

Then see if there is any memory segment left:
	ipcs -mop | grep ade
		For 64-bit Linux, use: ipcs -qms -a 
If you get a result, take note of the PID and remove it (you will need root access)
	ipcrm -m PID
Then, check the port again using
	netstat -a | grep dsrpc
You should not get any result. If you get any results and the dsrpc is in WAIT state, then you need to wait until it disappears (you can also reboot the machine).


Stop the ASB Agent (you need to be root user) 
	cd /opt/IBM/InformationServer/ASBNode/bin
	./NodeAgents.sh stop 
Type 'yes' if you receive the following message:
rm: remove write-protected regular file `Agent.pid'? 

Check the agent has stopped:
	ps -ef | grep -i agent|grep -v zabbix

	
Stop the WebSphere Application Server (you need to be root user) 
	cd /opt/IBM/InformationServer/ASBServer/bin
	./MetadataServer.sh stop
Now check there are no java processes left behind:
	ps -ef | grep java
	

Strart DS WAS
	cd /opt/IBM/InformationServer/ASBServer/bin
	./MetadataServer.sh run
Start the ASB Agent (you need to be root user) 
	cd /opt/IBM/InformationServer/ASBNode/bin
	./NodeAgents.sh start
Start the DSEngine: root
Follow the steps:
	cd /opt/IBM/InformationServer/Server/DSEngine
